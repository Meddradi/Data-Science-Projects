# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

This project predicts whether a passenger on the **Titanic** survived or not based on features like age, gender, class, and family relations.
It is one of the most popular beginner-friendly datasets in **Machine Learning** and is widely used for classification practice.

---

## ðŸ“– Problem Statement
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict survival on the Titanic based on passenger data.
